# MoviesRecommenderSystem
Recommender System for movies, based on reviews and adapted to each user.

## Setup:

For running this project you will need Python installed and the following libraries:

* Flask
* Pandas 
* Numpy 
* Pickle

After installing flask, open the command line (or Anaconda) and go to the folder where the project is stored.

Then run: python app.py 
The server will start.

Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:5000/
By this momment, the Movies Recommender System should be already running.

## Notes of the implementation:

The dataset used is the following: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Movies.html

The big ammount of data was understimated and the creation of the support files takes a longer than expected.

However, once the support files are created, the recommendations are speeded up. This also means that in order to get the recommendations you need the support files.

The visuals of the web page weren't taken care of since they are not the main purpose of the work.

Enjoy!
